## Technologies Used

- **React 19** - UI library
- **Vite 6** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Zod** - TypeScript-first schema validation
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 5173 is already in use, Vite will automatically try the next available port (5174, 5175, etc.).

### Dependencies Issues
If you encounter dependency issues, try:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Tailwind Styles Not Loading
Make sure you have the correct Tailwind CSS v4 setup. The project uses:
- `@import "tailwindcss";` in `src/index.css`
- `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin in `vite.config.js`

## Browser Support

This project uses modern CSS features and supports:
- Chrome 111+
